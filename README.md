# SoccerRoster

A lineup chart for USSF 4-3-3 implemented as a 4-2-3-1.
This is a well balanced formation in attack and defense with two holding
midfield players and one attacking midfielder.

Load the html in a web browser and print on an 8.5 x 11 landscape.
Currently you have to hand edit the html to put your roster in.
I'll probably implement a CSV import later.

Fill out the roster table with position numbers, X for sitting, or a - for out.
Then print.
