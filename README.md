# SoccerRoster

A lineup chart for USSF 4-3-3, 4-4-2, and 4-5-1 formations.

Works in Chrome and Firefox.  Not so much in Edge and IE.

Load the html in a web browser and print on an 8.5 x 11 landscape (set margins to minimal).
Currently you have to hand edit the roster.js file to put your roster in.
I'll probably implement a CSV import later.

Fill out the roster table with position numbers, - for sitting, then print.
