# SoccerRoster

A lineup chart for USSF 4-3-3 implemented as a 4-2-3-1.
This is a well balanced formation in attack and defense with two holding
midfield players and one attacking midfielder.

Works in Chrome and Firefox.  Not so much in Edge and IE.

Load the html in a web browser and print on an 8.5 x 11 landscape.
Currently you have to hand edit the roster.js file to put your roster in.
I'll probably implement a CSV import later.

Fill out the roster table with position numbers, - for sitting,
then print.
